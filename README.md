# Heart Attack Prediction

A heart attack (often called a myocardial infarction) occurs when the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle. When there isn't enough blood flowing to your heart muscle, the affected part can get damaged or die. This is dangerous and sometimes deadly.
